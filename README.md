# Audio Classification - UrbanSound8K

## Description
In this repository, I have implemented the concept of sound classification - which is considered as a "Hello World" - type problem for audio deep learning. In this project, we start with a sound file, convert them to the spectrograms, input them into the CNN plus Linear Classifier Model, and produce predictions about the class to which the sound belongs.
